# PacmanAI

### AI Pac-Man Game (Python)
Each project represents an AI/Machine Learning technique that I learned during that semester.

#### Project 1: Search
I implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

#### Project 2: Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. I implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designed evaluation functions.

#### Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
I implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

#### Project 4: Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. I implemented the exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

#### Project 5: Classification
I implemented standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. I extended this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
